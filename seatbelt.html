A seat belt (also known as a seatbelt or safety belt) is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop. A seat belt functions to reduce the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards, by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag (if equipped) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over.
    Seat belt use is one of the most effective ways to save lives and reduce injuries in crashes. Seat belts prevent drivers and passengers from being ejected during a crash. Parents should insist on seat belts on every trip and encourage their teens to buckle up before turning on the ignition. Sharing seat belt statistics with your teen will increase awareness of a proven way to stay safe on the road. </p>

    <b>MYTH 1:</b>
    <p>Seat belts are uncomfortable or inconvenient.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">  Initially people may find seat belts uncomfortable, confining or inconvenient simply because they're not used to wearing them. Those people who have made buckling up a habit can testify that once their use does become a habit, there is no discomfort or inconvenience.</div>

    <b>MYTH 2:</b>
    <p>Drivers in air bag-equipped vehicles don't need to wear seat belts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">Air bags provide supplemental protection in frontal crashes, but motorists can slide under them if they are not wearing a seat belt. In addition, air bags will not help in side or rear impact or rollover crashes. Motorists should wear a seat belt for protection in all types of crashes. </div>

    <b>MYTH 3:</b>
    <p>Seat belts can hurt you in a crash.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text"> Properly worn seat belts seldom cause injuries. If they do, the injuries are usually surface bruises and are generally less severe than would have been the case without any belt. Without seat belts, you could have been thrown out of the vehicle and severely injured. It is true that sometimes the force of a crash is so great that nothing could have prevented injuries. </div>

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">It only takes about three seconds to strap on your seat belt. That is less time than it takes to tie your shoe. Even if you are buckling up 20 times a day, that is only one minute of your day. </div>

    <b>MYTH 5:</b>
    <p>Seat belts trap you in your vehicle during a crash.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text"> This myth is often associated with fire- and water-related accidents, which account for less than one-half of one percent of all crashes. More importantly, seat belts can actually prevent you from being knocked unconscious, which can increase your chances of escaping during an accident.

  <ul>
    <li>More than half of teens (13 to 19 years) and adults (20 to 44 years) who died in motor vehicle crashes in 2015 were not wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.</li>
<br>
    <li>When used properly, seat belts reduce the risk of fatal injury to front seat passengers by 45 percent and the risk of moderate to critical injury by 50 percent.</li>
<br>
    <li>Seat belt use in passenger vehicles saved an estimated 13,941 lives in 2015.</li>
<br>
    <li>In 2015, 6.1 percent of teen passengers reported rarely or never wearing a seat belt recently, nearly a 20 percent decrease since 1991.</li>
<br>
    <li>People not wearing a seat belt are 30 times more likely to be ejected from a vehicle during a crash. More than 3 out of 4 people who are ejected during a fatal crash die from their injuries.</li>
<br>
    <li>Teens who say their parents set rules and monitor their driving are twice as likely to wear a seat belt as a driver or passenger as teens with less involved parents.</li>
