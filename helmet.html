    Next time you head out on a two-wheeler without wearing a helmet, stop and think again! A motorcycle crash can result in deadly head injuries that can often be fatal.
    William D. Singer, M.D. from Harvard Medical School explains, People who have an accident like that, and survive, often dont fully recover. 
	They may lose some intelligence, and the capacity to take care of themselves because of the damage to the system that controls their muscles.
	They may have a behavior change have difficulty dealing with other people, and having proper social relationships.
    All this, just because a motorist did not wear a helmet.
    The primary goal of a helmet is motorcycle safety to protect the riders head during impact, thus preventing or reducing head injury and saving the rider's life.

    <b>MYTH 1:</b>
    <p>Helmets Reduce Your Vision</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">Untrue! Well it may be just partially true for looking down, and only for full-face type helmets. But this is not important in any way. What is important is the peripheral vision, and it is about 180 degrees without a helmet. Helmet standards provide with 210-degree peripheral vision, so helmets do not reduce your important vision in any way.</div>

    <p>Helmets Prevent You from Hearing Traffic Sound</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">False! Helmets are useful for protecting your hearing from wind noise. Driving faster (say over 100kmph) without a helmet can damage your eardrums over time (not to mention other problems). While helmets lower all noise and sounds, they are not completely eliminating those. Critical traffic sounds are heard very clearly. </div>

    <p>Helmets Overheat your Head</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">Wrong! Studies have shown that the foam liner inside the helmet acts as an insulator and while outer surface of the helmet may warm up, inside temperature will not rise more than a few degrees. However, while moving at slow speeds air circulation will be low even on the well-ventilated helmets, and it may get hot in there.</div>

    <div class="text">Wrong again! There is much more risk involved when driving in the city, as opposed to driving in rural areas.There are all those parked cars, light poles, people and many other objects that are on your way. And in fact, even if you are riding slow, the distance you drop is the same. You can not control other drivers behavior either someone can crash a car into you accidentally, and you will not be prepared whatsoever.</div>

  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">Untrue! Research shows that riders who use helmets are less likely to get in any road accidents and surprisingly, bright helmet colors such as white, red or white have even less accident ratio! In fact, all good quality helmets come with reflectors (text or signals) which ensure you become visible in the dark which definitely saves than your bare head!</div>

  <p>India has among the most unsafe roads in the world. In 2015, over 400 people were killed in road accidents every day.
  In the same year, two-wheeler accidents claimed 36,800 victims and left around 93,400 injured. Numbers that could have been significantly lower, if riders had proper helmets.

  If that statistic are not scary enough, the situation seems to be getting worse every year.

  A recent study published by the United Nations suggests that about 15,000 lives across the world can be saved each year, if motorcyclists start wearing appropriate helmets.
  Pointing out how two-wheelers are one of the most unsafe modes of transport, the UN Motorcycle Helmet Study says that Motorcyclists are 26 times more likely to die in a road crash than drivers of passenger cars. Wearing an appropriate helmet improves their chances of survival by 42% and helps avoid 69% of injuries to riders.</p>
  <p>The study also makes a dire projection. Between the years 2008 and 2020, almost 34 lakh people might die of motorcycle crashes. A figure that can be halved with appropriate measures. As many as 14 lakh of those fatalities can be avoided with the proper use of safety helmets, the study says.

<p>Wearing a motorcycle helmet can reduce the risk of death in the event of a crash by up to 40% and the chance of a serious injury by up to 70%.

Yet according to World Health Organization research only 40% of countries have a comprehensive helmet law and effective helmet standards. Check the helmet laws of your country below.</p>
