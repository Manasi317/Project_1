    Speeding is defined as exceeding the posted speed limit, driving too fast for conditions, or racing, is a dangerous driving behavior that is often overlooked.
    Speeding is often one component of aggressive driving, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defines as "committing a combination of moving traffic offenses so as to endanger other persons or property." Some states have passed aggressive driving laws that delineate these actions, including: speeding; red light running; failure to yield; following too closely; improper passing; etc.
To make progress toward zero deaths on our nation's roadways, both speeding and aggressive driving deserve the same emphasis as occupant protection and impaired driving programs.
States are combating speeding and aggressive driving in several ways, including increased data-driven enforcement, technological advances, and public information and education programs that focus on the dangers of aggressive driving, provide tips for safe driving or publicize upcoming enforcement programs.
Speeding endangers everyone on the road: In 2017, speeding killed 9,717 people, accounting for more than a quarter (26%) of all traffic fatalities that year.

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text"> Many factors contribute to the collisions we investigate. Speed is one of them. Higher speed is directly linked to the chance of fatalities. If you are going more slowly there is more margin for error and more chance you will survive.</div>

    <p>Going a few miles per hour over the speed limit does not really matter.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">If you hit a pedestrian at 35 mph, you are twice as likely to kill them as at 30mph. That is a massive difference to cut seconds off your journey.</div>

    <p>The police only target speeding drivers because they are a cash cow.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">We target speeding drivers because we have to gather body parts from the carriageway at fatal crashes and break life changing news to families. You will never have to experience those things. But we do. We target speeding drivers because we know the next casualty could be you even if you do not want to believe it.

  <ul>
    <li>  <b>More fuel consumption-</b> Cars are designed to be driven up to a certain speed range to get the best gas mileage. Therefore over speeding will lead to a higher fuel consumption. The higher the speed especially if above 120km/h, the more fuel the car will consume.</li>

    <li> <b> Increased possibility of accident-</b> Crash, death, severe injury, manslaughter, I am sure you don not like the sound of all that. Especially on our Nigerian roads where we have potholes, jaywalkers, okadas, Danfos etc. Over-speeding  gives you a shorter time to respond to obstructions on your path. A fraction of a second can mean a lot of difference between life and death. Drive at reasonable speed or within speed limits for your safety and that of those around you.</li>

    <li><b>Damage of vehicle-</b> The damage could result from a crash, potholes you could not avoid, engine wear etc. Your car tyres also have speed ratings and could get damaged if you go beyond the recommended speed rating. Even if you argue that frequently driving your car at high RPMs does not damage your car, I am sure you will still agree lower RPMs are relatively better for your engine.</li>

  <li><b>  Air pollution-</b>Levels of air pollution can be significantly reduced by less aggressive driving and by simply reducing your speed. Researchers studied air quality on some Amsterdam roads, where the speed limit was lowered from 100 km/h to 80 km/h, and found that levels of some pollutants were reduced by up to 15 per cent. This means you could be saving the whole world as well as posterity by not driving too fast.</li>

    <li><b> Bad for your health-</b>Speeding can increase your anxiety level.. this is okay if it occurs once in a while. However, wanting to be the road champion 24/7 could lead to chronic anxiety. This definitely comes with a bunch of health issues from physical health degradation to mental disorder. I am sure you do not want to go crazy with road rage.</li>

According to WHO, only 47 countries, representing approximately 950 million people, have urban speed laws that meet best practice. Check the speed limit laws in your country below.</p>

    <div class="text"> No matter how good a driver you are, you can not change the laws of physics. The faster you drive, the more likely you are to lose control of your vehicle and the longer it will take you to stop.
