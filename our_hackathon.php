  <h3 style="text-align:center;">FORMATION OF RYDA</h3>
  <p>In 2000, four teenage boys were killed in a car driven by an inexperienced P plater. The car smashed into
  an innocent womens vehicle, the woman was seriously injured and all four young men died. The local Rotary Club 
  decided that something had to be done and the first RYDA program was conducted by the St Ives Rotary Club in 2001. 
  This was the beginning of RYDA a Youth Driver Awareness community based road safety initiative created to deliver 
  practical road safety information targeting attitude and awareness of young drivers and passengers. RYDA is designed
  to help stop the tragic loss of young people in road crashes.</p>

  <p>Every country has its own road safety rules and regulations for the best interests of citizens. 
  Road safety rules in India are designed as per the best interests of citizens. As a citizen, you have
  certain important roles and responsibilities. For making the safety efforts successful,We have designed a web
  site which will tell about the importance of road safety and also about the rules and regulation to be followed.</p>
  <p>As you a citizen of a huge country like India, you may face problem in rule execution. India is a country having 
  29 states, each having their own governing body, villages, panchayats etc. and hence it is a difficult task
  to manage them effectively. So we are trying to make a simple wensite which
  will reach the people and will increase road awareness.</p><br>

  <p>Every one seconds, a road accident takes place, and every four seconds a person dies due to a road accident, somewhere in the world. 
  Just one safer driver on the road can make a huge difference; imagine what it would be like to drive on the road if we all tried a 
  little harder to be better! Sure, accidents happen, but if we work together to educate ourselves and the generations after us the importance 
  of road safety, we can work our way toward making that number lower and lower each year, and save thousands of lives as a result.</P><br>
