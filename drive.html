   Drunk driving puts at risk not only the life of the person behind the wheel, but also of innocent people.  Impairment by alcohol is an important factor in causing accidents .
   According to the World Health Organization, The immediate effects of alcohol on the brain are either depressing or stimulating in nature, depending on the quantity consumed. 
   It further says that alcohol consumption results in impairment which increases the likelihood of a crash since it produces poor judgment, increased reaction time, lower 
   vigilance and decreased visual acuity. Physiologically, alcohol also lowers blood pressure and depresses consciousness and respiration. Alcohol can impair judgment 
   and increase crash risk even at relatively low Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) levels. However, the effects become progressively worse as the BAC increases.

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text"  style="font-size:1.25vw">Untrue! You could be impaired even if your blood alcohol concentration is low, and you could even be arrested with a blood alcohol concentration below.Don't depend on your blood alcohol concentration to know if you are impaired, since many other factors can come into play, such as fatigue, drugs, medication, stress or illness.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.25vw">False! We often hear that not having any alcohol for an hour prior to driving is a good habit. However, this may only be true if you have limited consumption to a minimum. If you have had too much to drink, waiting an hour will not change your condition.

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.25vw">Wrong! Studies have shown that For the same amount of alcohol consumed and at the same weight, women usually have a slightly higher blood alcohol concentration. However, a person's sex has a fairly negligible effect compared to other factors that come into play, such as weight, rate of alcohol absorption by the stomach, fatigue or medication.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.25vw">Wrong again! If you drink on an empty stomach, the alcohol passes directly into the intestine and from there into the bloodstream and brain. There are no barriers to the absorption of alcohol, which literally goes straight to your head. Eating after drinking alcohol does not change anything â€“ it's too late since the alcohol is already in your bloodstream.</div>

  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.25vw">Untrue! Research shows that Cocktails aren't always as light as they might seem. Two ounces of alcohol is still two ounces of alcohol, whether it is mixed with fruit juice or not. Beware of cocktails mixed without a jigger.</div>

  <p style="font-size:1.25vw">The statistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that in 2016 an estimated 9,040 people were killed or injured in drink-drive accidents, a rise of 7% from 8,470 in 2015. The total number of accidents where at least one driver or rider was over the legal alcohol limit rose by 6% to 6,070 in 2016. The final estimate of drink-drive fatalities of 230 for 2016 is higher than in 2015, but the rise was reported as not statistically significant and fatalities appear stable since 2012.</p>
  
  <p style="font-size:1.25vw">Often it is an innocent person who suffers, not the driver who is over the drink drive limit. In 2016, 100
pedestrians were killed or seriously injured by drink drivers, as were 390 car passengers. 40 children were
killed or seriously injured by drink drivers that year.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.25vw">in 2017, 325,887 roadside breath tests were carried out by the police, of which 44,893 drivers or riders (14% of
those tested) failed or refused to take the test.</p>
